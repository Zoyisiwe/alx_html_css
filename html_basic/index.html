        <h1>How Am I finding the ALX SWE course?</h1>
        <p>It is a very interesting course and with all the mentors (Cole) explaining how everything works, 
            the whole process is honestly interesting to say the least</p>
        <p>And it is educational, learning how the web works is fascinating,
             I am already fascinated by what I know, or what I've learnt,
              imagine how I'll feel when I learn more, WOW.</p>

        <h2>What do I think about Cole?</h2>
        <p>I don't think that matters, but honestly, he is an outsanding teacher,
             and he is gifted, or actually, he is LOL, he loves coding,
              nontheless, The whole ALX team is doing a good job,
               because they are changing not how we think but also the world,
                thats cool, God bless them hey!!!</p>
        <h3>What about your peers?</h3>
        <p>They are amazing, or should I say WE are amazing, 
            the way everybody is willing to learn and teach
             at the same time is amazing.</p>
